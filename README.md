# Onboarding
## Welcome to the Phage Hunters Training and Research Program 
We are a dynamic team of phage enthusiasts from Kenya, united by a shared vision to inspire and empower the next generation of scientists in Africa and other Low & Middle-income countries to pursue phage research.

Our aim is to address the critical need for novel therapeutics in the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a looming global crisis that could cause approximately 10 million deaths annually by 2050.

## What We Do

* Research: We conduct cutting-edge research on bacteriophages, exploring their interactions with bacterial pathogens and potential applications in therapy and biotechnology.
Training: Our comprehensive training programs provide hands-on experience in phage hunting and related methodologies, empowering participants with practical skills.

* Collaboration: We partner with leading institutions, researchers, and healthcare professionals worldwide to foster a collaborative environment that drives innovation.
